	//Difference Between Implicit, Explicit and Fluent Wait
	//Implicit Wait:
	/*	During Implicit wait if the Web Driver cannot find it immediately because 
	of its availability, it will keep polling (around 250 milli seconds) the 
	DOM (Document object model)to get the element. If the element is not available within the specified 
	Time an NoSuchElementException will be raised. The default setting is zero.
	Once we set a time, the Web Driver waits for the period of the WebDriver 
	object instance.*/

	//Explicit Wait:
	/*There can be instance when a particular element takes more than a minute to load.
		In that case you definitely not like to set a huge time to Implicit wait, as if 
		you do this your browser will going to wait for the same time for every element.

	To avoid that situation you can simply put a separate time on the required element only. 
	By following this your browser implicit wait time would be short for every element 
	and it would be large for specific element.
	 */
	//Fluent Wait: 
	/*		Let’s say you have an element which sometime appears in just 1 second and some
		time it takes minutes to appear. In that case it is better to use fluent wait, 
		as this will try to find element again and again until it find it or until the 
		final timer runs out*/
